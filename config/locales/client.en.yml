        In your broadcasting software (for example Mixxx), create a new connection with the following settings:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Server</strong>: stream.heartbeatpleasure.com</li>
          <li><strong>Port</strong>: 8001</li>
          <li><strong>Mount / Stream name</strong>: use the mount shown above.</li>
          <li><strong>Username</strong>: your username on this website.</li>
          <li><strong>Password</strong>: your stream key.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you generate a new stream key later, remember to update the password in your broadcasting software.</p>
        <p>Keep these details private. Anyone who has them can broadcast live as you.</p>
